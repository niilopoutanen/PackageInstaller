# PackageInstaller
Simple program that allows to install given package to computer. This is not free to use, it is meant for my own projects only.

The application unpacks given zip file to Appdata/Local/temp, and moves it from there to given Program Files folder. After that the app creates a shortcut to desktop and deletes the package from temp folder.
